# HW3-Password-Generator

## Password Generating Applicaiton

### The objective of this project was to modify starter code to create an applicaiton that enables the user to generate random passwords based on criteria that they've selected. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS and is powered by JavaScript. Mastering the techniques with JavaScript is my goal to be marketable to employers. Therefore this exercise was very valuable to me. I learned how to apply many JavaScript techniques such as for loops, while loops, and functions to create interactive applications.
